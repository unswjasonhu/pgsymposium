<p>The manufacturing industry is under high pressure to improve and maintain product quality and process performance under stringent environmental and safety regulations. Additionally, emerging requirements for the reduction in environmental footprint, material, energy, and water consumption have added to these pressures. Companies are more eager than ever to find a tool that facilitates their efforts towards sustainability within their manufacturing systems and to improve their economic and environmental performance.</p>
<p>In this regard, a holistic view of the entire manufacturing system is needed in which the dynamic behaviour of the production processes, supporting services and their interrelationships are considered. Due to the fact that the underlying system is too complex, it is vital to utilise simulation to model the system. Furthermore, a simulation model can be used to study the optimal performance of the system in terms of existing trade-offs between economic and environmental performance measures.</p>
<p>This research attempts to address the shortcomings of current approaches in regards to holistic and multi-dimensional sustainability evaluation of a manufacturing system. This is to enable complex and data intensive analysis of multiple performance measures (economic &amp; environmental) in order to facilitate decision making in the area of manufacturing system improvement and optimisation.</p>
<p>This is achieved by:</p>
<p>a)     Developing a framework that can provide a breakdown of material and energy consumption during manufacturing of a product (from single machine through to aggregated factory level) for better transparency of where, when and how the resources are consumed.</p>
<p>b)     Using simulation to handle the complexity and dynamics involved in modelling and calculation of the material and the energy flows within the manufacturing system.</p>
<p>a.     This supports “hot spot” analysis of environmental and economic performance through generating a value stream map.</p>
<p>b.     This supports “what-if” scenario building by varying product types and batch sizes, changes in process parameters like set up time, job sequencing / load levelling and/or process chain variation.</p>
<p>c)     Using simulation-optimisation with the aim of finding the optimum solution based on batch sizing, load levelling and the process chain that will result in the most desirable outcome in terms of both economic and environmental aspects.</p>

<p>Supercritical fluids (SCFs) find useful application in performing green chemistry and engineering, especially in pharmaceutical industry. The concern for sustainable environment was the main impetus for using SCFs. Micro-structured devices have attracted increasing interest in intensifying processes in recent years. However, these tools were only very recently made compatible for high pressure or high temperature processes.</p>
<p>In this study, the hypothesis that dense gas based microfluidic processes can be developed as an intensified and effective technique to micronize drug particles was tested using a poorly water-soluble pharmaceutical: copper indomethacin. Carbon dioxide (CO2) was used as an antisolvent to conduct precipitation of the drugs within a microfluidic system under supercritical conditions. The experiments were designed with the aim to optimize the process; the effects of operating parameters, namely temperature, pressure, flow rates of drug solution and CO2 were manipulated to reduce particle size and improve product yield. The Taguchi Method (TM) and Response Surface Methodology (RSM) were introduced to improve operating conditions and run statistical analysis. In the study of synthesis and micronisation of copper indomethacin, particles of diameter less than 5μm were produced at a yield of 80% and the purity of the product was upwards of 95%. The results from the particle size distribution analysis indicated that 90% of the product consisted of particles that were less than 8μm in diameter. The statistical analysis results also demonstrated that temperature and pressure were two significant factors affecting product yield while the flow rates of CO2 and solution had minor impact.</p>
<p>Working under the dense gas or supercritical conditions at micro-scale combines the advantage of size reduction provided by micro-devices to the unique properties of the dense gas or supercritical fluids, and brings benefits to particle engineering.</p>
<p>Key words: dense gas technology, microfluidic processes, micro-mixer, copper indomethacin, process intensification</td>
